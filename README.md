# Project Overview

This project involves real-time face detection and blurring using Python, OpenCV, and dlib. It's designed to detect multiple 
faces in live video footage from a webcam and apply a Gaussian blur to each detected face. The purpose is to enhance privacy 
and anonymity in video streams.

**Requirements**
Python 3.11
OpenCV (opencv-python)
dlib


**Usage**
* Run the script to start the face detection and blurring process. The video feed will open in a new window. 
* Press 'q' to quit the application.

**Key Features**
* Utilizes dlib for robust face detection.
* Dynamically adjusts the blur intensity based on face size.
* Operates in real-time using live footage from the webcam.

**Limitations**
* Performance depends on the hardware capabilities.
* Lighting and camera quality can affect detection accuracy.

**Future Enhancements**
* Implementing a user interface for real-time parameter adjustments.
* Optimizing performance for lower-end hardware.
* Expanding functionality for different video sources.
* This project is open for contributions and further enhancements.
